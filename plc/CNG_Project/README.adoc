=== Create a CNG project

  - the MBase V4.39 is currently required
  - click on PLC perspective then on CNG symbol and fill it
  - create a pattern in CFC or ST
  - a cng-folder is created with 3 sub-folders ( functions, pattern, types)
  - click on the pattern symbol and edit it
  - Right click on project -> Cng Editor -> select project -> add component -> select pattern
  - by entering the name under "Identifier/Name", a global variable with the same name is generated
  - all generated components are located under the folder "Location"
  - Enter varaible-name
  - save and create PLC
  - now all patterns are excluded and global variables are generated
  - the components can also be inserted directly under "project.jason"
