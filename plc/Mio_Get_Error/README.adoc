= Read specific error and event interrupts from GIO212, AIO216 and AIO208 in PLC

== Current configuration from GIO212 in SolutionCenter

=== Case of Limit as error not activated

    - click on GIO212
    - go to primary Channels 01-02

    -> Primary Channel 1:  
                          * Mode:     CurrentIn
                          * Range:    4-20mA                      
    -> Primary Channel 2:  
                          * Mode:     CurrentOut
                          * Range:    0-20mA
                          
     - under pin Assignment you can see how the channels are connected
     - than now you can save the configuration and reboot.
     - after reboot hardware symbol will show red(error).
     - we can have this error in plc using function `MIO_GetError´

== Build function Mio in plc

        - create a new PLC_Projekt
        - insert Mio_plc.plclib
        - create a function to get error
        - Call function in plc_Prg
        - Compile and debug the plc_Prg
        - With a breakpoint we can have under `State´ the error
        - error is delivered in form of a 32 bits
        - in this case status = 65540 => Open circuit, Lowerrange exceeded(on device protocol)
