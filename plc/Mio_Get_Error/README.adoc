= Read specific error and event interrupts from GIO212, AIO216 and AIO208 in PLC

== Current configuration from GIO212 in SolutionCenter

    - click on GIO212
    - go to primary Channels 01-02

    -> Primary Channel 1:  
                          * Mode:     CurrentIn
                          * Range:    4-20mA                      
    -> Primary Channel 2:  
                          * Mode:     CurrentOut
                          * Range:    0-20mA
                          
     - under `pin Assignment´ you can see how the channels are connected
     - than now you can save the configuration and reboot.
     - after reboot hardware symbol will show red(error).
     - we can have this error in plc using function `MIO_GetError´
     
===  Possible configuration errors and graphical representation

   - if `Limit as error´ is inactive and `CurrentIn < 4mA´ :   Open circuit, Lowerrange exceeded

   - if `Limit as error´ is inactive and `CurrentIn > 20mA´ :   Upperrange exceeded

   - if `Limit as error´ is aktiv and `CurrentIn < Lower limit(7mA)´: Open circuit, Lowerrange exceeded
   
image::aktiv_Ie_klein_7mA.png[] 

   - if `Limit as error´ is aktiv and `CurrentIn > Upper limit(19mA)´:  Open circuit, Upperrange exceeded

IMPORTANT:  if `Disable errors´ is activated, all errors are eliminated: +

                              

== How to get error in plc ?

        - create a new PLC_Projekt
        - insert Mio_plc.plclib
        - create a function to get error
        - Call function in plc_Prg
        - Compile and debug the plc_Prg
        - With a breakpoint we can have under `State´ the error
        - The error information is returned in form of a bit mask

=== Case of error in different configuration:

- `Limit as error´ is (inactive) and `CurrentIn < 4mA´: State = 65540   =>  Open circuit, Lowerrange exceeded

image::erste Fall(65540).png[]

- `Limit as error´ is (inactive) and `CurrentIn > 20mA´:  State = 131072 => Upperrange exceeded

image::inactive_20mA.png[]

- `Limit as error´ is (active) and `CurrentIn < Lower limit´:  State = 65536 => Lowerrange exceeded

image::active_7mA.png[]

- `Limit as error´ is (active) and `CurrentIn > Upper limit´:  State = 131072 => Upperrange exceeded

IMPORTANT:  constants for error interrupts

- With the following link you can see the general description of specific error interrupts

-> you can also have this specific description in Mio_plclib under global variables:

Lowerrange exceeded = 16#00010000   =>      65536   +
Upperrange exceeded = 16#00020000   =>      131072  +
Open circuit        = 16#0004       =>      4   +
